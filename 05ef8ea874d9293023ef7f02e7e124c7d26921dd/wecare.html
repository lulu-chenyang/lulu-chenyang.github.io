			<p>As families become distant as part of globalization and millennials migrating to find new exciting opportunities they become distant from their family.  Most of them are unable to bring their family along specifically their parents. As parents tend to get older they become more susceptible to chronic illness due to lack of active lifestyle or hereditary reasons. The children who are away from their parents are unable to monitor their parents' health condition and encourage them to lead an active lifestyle. This project humbly attempts to solve this particular problem area by remotely keeping updated of the parents’ health and encourage them to lead an active lifestyle. The interface is designed to be used in the context of a user anywhere they can use a smart phone.</p>

			<h3>Needfinding Plan</h3>
			<h4>User type</h4>
			<p><br>The new interface design will be aimed towards 2 primary stakeholders/users.</br>
1. Parents: These are seniors looking for assistance to maintain a healthy lifestyle that are comfortable with sharing some of their medical data.
Demographic  Information:  These are parents of adult children, with the average age ranging from 44 to 78 years based on the average birth age[2] + 18 and the average age of death.[3]
Expertise:  Senior users will be closer to novice or inexperienced users in expertise due to their smartphone adoption rate[4] to be about half of younger adults.   
Motivations: The parent will desire assistance in maintaining their health choices and activities.  A secondary motivation will be those looking to improve inter-family communications.
2. Children of the Parents:  These are children who would like to take a more active role in helping to encourage their parents towards a healthy lifestyle.
Demographic Information: The children will be adults typically ranging from 18 – 40.   
Expertise:  With the majority of young adults using smartphones[4], the average child of a parent will be in-between an average user’s expertise level up to an expert level.
Motivations:  The children will be those wanting to ensure that their parents' health is a high priority.</p>

			<br><h5>2. Children of the Parents: </h5> </br>
			<p>These are children who would like to take a more active role in helping to encourage their parents towards a healthy lifestyle.
			Demographic Information: The children will be adults typically ranging from 18 – 40.   
			Expertise:  With the majority of young adults using smartphones[4], the average child of a parent will be in-between an average user’s expertise level up to an expert level.
			Motivations:  The children will be those wanting to ensure that their parents' health is a high priority.</p>
			<h4>Survey</h4>
			<p>13 questions are generated for an internet-based survey to identify who are the users, what are the users' goals, what are the users' tasks, what is the context of the tasks, and what do the users need.</p>
			<p>Confirmation bias will be limited by avoiding leading question, adding question allowing neutral responses, and reviewing survey responses as a group. Voluntary response bias will be difficult to overcome due to the participation credit offered to participants.</p>
<!-- Create a div where the graph will take place -->

			<script src="https://canvasjs.com/assets/script/canvasjs.min.js"></script>
 -->			<h5>Key take-aways</h5>
			<li>The majority of participants are in the age range 26-35. This correlates well with the national average master student’s age of 33[ref #1].</li>

These same devices cover the information participants would like to monitor and would be willing to purchase for their parents.</li>
			<li>Majority would be interested in seeing medical report health data.</li>

			</li>
			<h4>Interview</h4>
			<p>8 interviews are conducted to seniors' fitness behavior, health-related communication with their children, and usage of technology to inform design decision in later phases. </p>
			<p>During this needfinding, social desirability bias, confirmation bias and observer bias  are possible. Confirmation bias will be limited by scripting down questions . Social desirability bias will be limited by disclosing results would be kept anonymous. Observer bias will be constrained by reviewing the interview responses as a group.</p>
