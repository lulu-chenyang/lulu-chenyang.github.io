			<p>I was surprised that more than 60% of the testers are unlikely to recommend the DARWIN system to their friend and colleague. The dissatisfaction majorly came from 3 aspect:

			<br>01 Poor connectivity and integration with hardware
			<br>02 Lack of simplicity and consistency in the UX
			<br>03 No personalization in the algorithm

			<br>It's not a Simple UX/UI Problem. To make a delightful IoT product and improve satisfaction, we need team effort.
