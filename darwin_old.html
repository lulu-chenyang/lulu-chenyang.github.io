		</div>
		<div class="col-lg-9">
			<h4>The Unique Challenge</h4>
			<p>As a wellness intelligence platform, DARWIN would like to improve the health & well-being of people by leveraging the places they live, work, and play… However, when software meets hardwares, challenges are raising from connectivity to consistency and usability, etc. Most of the smart home ecosystems are disconnected, experiences are siloed, while people want their homes to do more for them. Furthermore, from users’ perspective there’s also too much noise & complexity within the wellness space to know exactly what to do.</p>


			
<!-- 			To ground our ideation for how to improve
			the current end user experience, the team
			empathized with Linda — a busy, working
			mother and wife, living in “middle America”.
			We then ideated to identify the top pains in
			Linda’s life and collectively (along with many
			more!) voted where Delos could provide
			value:

			– Worry about children
			– Financial concerns
			– Stress
			– Trouble falling asleep
			– Don’t get enough sleep -->


<!-- 			The feedback from software and hardware can be given to the user at different time and space. </p>
			<p>The impact of wellness is not be visible by the users in the short-term</p>
			<p>One of the callenges is how to “Make the air quality data accessible and empowering” </p>
			<p>Customer got data but not information and they usually ignore the data very soon.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>We are athlete and referee at the same time: </li>
				<li>There is a trade-off between the amount of information that can be displayed (expressiveness) and the degree to which the specified goals can be achieved (effectiveness).</li>
				<li>Does majority of users want to be more engaged or automated? Have more information or less details? Know anything specifically?</li>

			<h4>Working Process</h4>
			<p>Bring in design thinking working process to the team. Organized multiple stake holder workshop, lead user interviews and surveys, collected and analyzed user feedback in alpha/beta testing. Bridge the gap between scientific research and product development.</p>
			<!-- <p>The research and development are originally in two different department. Research department wrote innovative algorithm based on scentific study and literature review. Product department hired external designer to develop prototype and push to production phase very fast. To improve the communication and get everyone on the same page, I organized a seriers of brainstorming sessions with stakeholders from each department before the scientists start to develop the algorithm. Low-fi prototypes are developed to translate pages of document into grahic which easy to understand. Another workshop was organized to communicated the concept and logic behind the algortihm. The low-fi prototype were passed to product development with a series of user studies including survey and interview. The design was alterated and revised based on the user study report. The new working process with design think bridged the gaps between research and product development.</p> -->

			<p>The reports will supplement and not replicate information that provided to users through the Darwin App dashboard. </p>
			<h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
			<p>More than 8 performance reports and dashboards are analyzed. The methods used in those reports are summarized as below: </p>

			<b><p>Comparisons, Aggregations, Distributions, Achievement, Advice</p></b>

			<p>Users will feel most satified when they perceive that they are getting value out of Darwin and getting updates of the progress. The content of the report must be considered useful, interesting and nonrepetitive to the user.
