		<p><a href="https://delos.com.au/"><b>DARWIN</b></a> is the world's first wellness intelligence platform. DARWIN provides holistic & responsive intelligence passively promotes wellness in the home and mitigates the environmental factors that can impact our health, happiness and wellbeing. Under the brand of DARWIN, there are two product line: </p>
		
		<p>I've been working on DARWIN for 3 years, from market research, algorithm development, user flow, wireframe, mockups, to establish company-wise user study process, lead Beta testing, build testing platform etc. I've worked on almost every feature of the product crossing three different product lines: </p>
		<p>Features: 
		<b>Dawn simulation / Circadian Lighting / Water Filteration / Air Purification / Air Quality Monitoring / Behavioral Intervention</b></p>

		<p>Product line: 
			<br><b>DARWIN</b>, mass market product
			<br><b>DARWIN Premier</b>, luxury and high-end product, integrated with Crestron, Savant, Control4
			<br><b>DARWINX</b>, internal testing platform for fast prototyping and delopyment</p>

		<div class="col-lg-9">
			<p>When software meets hardwares, there are challenges ranging from connectivity, configuration, consistency, to usability, etc. As a wellness intelligence platform, DARWIN™ intuitively responds to the conditions in users’ home, purifying air and water and providing dynamic lighting designed to restore body’s natural rhythms. All of these make it a very complex system. To design the interaction, closely collaborations are required with architects, property owners, software engineers, hardware engineers, PMs, data scientists, behavior scientists, air quality expert, lighting expert, acoustic experience, integrators, etc.</p>

<!-- 			The feedback from software and hardware can be given to the user at different time and space. </p>
			<p>The impact of wellness is not be visible by the users in the short-term</p>
			<p>One of the callenges is how to “Make the air quality data accessible and empowering” </p>
			<p>Customer got data but not information and they usually ignore the data very soon.</p>

		<div class="col-lg-9">
			<p>Bring in design thinking working process to the team. Organized multiple stake holder workshop, lead user interviews and surveys, collected and analyzed user feedback in alpha/beta testing. Bridge the gap between scientific research and product development.</p>
			<!-- <p>The research and development are originally in two different department. Research department wrote innovative algorithm based on scentific study and literature review. Product department hired external designer to develop prototype and push to production phase very fast. To improve the communication and get everyone on the same page, I organized a seriers of brainstorming sessions with stakeholders from each department before the scientists start to develop the algorithm. Low-fi prototypes are developed to translate pages of document into grahic which easy to understand. Another workshop was organized to communicated the concept and logic behind the algortihm. The low-fi prototype were passed to product development with a series of user studies including survey and interview. The design was alterated and revised based on the user study report. The new working process with design think bridged the gaps between research and product development.</p> -->

However, people can’t notice pollutants in the air, and they are not aware of how simple actions like opening windows can remediate CO2 and keep their indoor air clean.
